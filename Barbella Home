<p>Barbella grew up on the dark sid of the moon. She worked for an epedition teamsent here to steal the formula for gummy worms. 
Unfortunately, her timekeeping devices malfunctioned due to the humid weather we have had recently. 
This caused her to miss her return flight. The nexxt chance to return home is during a lunar eclipse of a blue moon. 
Now she is stranded here, ,alone, afraid, and unable to speak the language or understand our culture.</p>
<p>We met her at an office building. She was hiding under the back picnic table. 
She was trying to fend off the romantic attentions of an overly aggressive male pigeon. We Rescued her.</p>
<p>She only has $1.41 which she picked up out of the grass; so she'll need your assistance with obtaining what she'll need. 
She also has a roll of NECCO'S (which she considers a delicacy, but is willing to share).</p>
<p>She wants to make the most of this opportunity by keeping a record of her experiences. 
She has asked everyone to write everyday about her experiences. She wants to collect some artifacts while here. 
She had an empty pringle can to collect signatures of interesting people she might meet. 
Please be kind and show her a good time while she is with you.</p>
<p>She prefers to sleep in bags where it is nice and cozy-occasionally she might need new quarters if the present one gets too tattered.
Please pass her around so that she gets to meet all of the family.</p>
